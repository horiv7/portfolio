# Portfolio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.

Live: https://portfolio-ce3b1.web.app

My personal portfolio was not online. I decided to create one like many others developers. Wherever the Turks go, Mujo will go too.


My goal was to create a simple presentation site. I wanted it in dark mode. A contact form was also a must.


Searches led me to this UI. The frontend was done in Angular. In order to implement the backend contact form, I created a simple server in NodeSs using the Gmail service.


Then I wrote a copy and here it is.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

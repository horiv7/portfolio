          You've probably read hundreds (maybe thousands) of CVs and
          portfolio sites each year.

          You could say this is another guy who read in the newspapers that
          salaries are good in the IT industry. So he took a course at Udemy. He
          went through a bit of HTML and CSS and is waiting for the world to bow
          to him.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yes, you are right. I took one course on HTML and CSS at Udemy. Then
          one for Python, and one another for Javascript, Then Angular, etc. I
          also went to Frontend Academy for ETF BL for half a year. And one
          month of practice in the infamous Prointer ITSS. On Udemy, I took still
          more courses.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But that doesn't mean anything to you because you see a lot of people
          putting in their CV everything they've heard and seen.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So you tell yourself: "This dude doesn't have enough experience, he
          has bad English, he didn't work in a team!" Of course, it is true. I
          know that. I take English classes, I code whenever I have time. I use
          agile tools to manage my daily tasks.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But that is certainly not enough. I know what it means to get out of
          your comfort zone. I'm going out too. I work in high school and I like
          that. But I know I have to step out if I want something more from my
          life.
